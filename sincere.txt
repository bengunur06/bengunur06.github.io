From the sincerest parts of my mind ,
I am overthinking lately ,Espacially about my past friendships .There is specific one that i can't forget.
The one that stayed anonymous till it fades .But there was no begining nor end for it ,it was between us .
At that time i was an oversensetive person ,i used to get offended from smallest things that you can imagine . 
And i was very offensive to that friend too ,i have taken all the jokes seriously (all of them) ,never understand my friends emotions at that time
,so i had an attitude towards my friend. There are so many things that i wanted to tell ,but now it feels like it's too lately.
There is a feeling that like i have been late to all of the things . When you hold back something either your feelings or thoughts it always comes out in a way 
that can be really painful . That's what i am experiencing . I keeped so many things bootled up about it . Every day,every night in my mind there they are .
I know that person was rude to me also disrespectful but i shouldn't hold back the things that i wanted to say to them .
I tried at least ,failed ,but tried.It has been a long time ,what can i say maybe i am forgotten by that person .But at the midnight or at the sunrise ,comes to my mind . 


I am overthinking lately.
