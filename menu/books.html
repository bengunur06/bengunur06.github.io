		<i>written by Dante </i><br>
		this is a book that needs to be read with good tranlated version  because one of the features of this book is being poetic but when i read the book in my language i didn't like the translation book almost lost the meaning to me 
		so i read some parts of the book from internet in english of course i didn't leard italian to read the book but english translators did a such a good job at keeping the poetic part of the book
		<a href="https://digitaldante.columbia.edu/dante/divine-comedy/">This is a link to read it in good translation</a>
		<br>
		Death of Beatrice makes Dante write the divine comedy 
		in the book <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Virgil">Virgil</a> guides Dante to inferno and purgatorio then 
		Beatrice guides him to Paradise 
		as i said book is meaningful to read with poetic translation so if you want to read it i suggest you to read it in english translation if you can italian but not turkish 
		4 years ago i stopped using turkish translations if i can find english version of it i try to use it.
		For example watching a anime or readin a comic ,because the translators doesn't bother with literature or poetic ways of a piece they just want to translate of course there ara some exceptions but very little .Translating is an important job because the translator creates the piece in language again so they have to have a knowledge of literature and manega both of the languages not just the foreign one for example 
		a english-turkish translator must know english as much as turkish so the translated piece still have literaturel value from the mother language of it .

		<h2>MR. Mercedes </h2>
		<img  src="/images/mrMercedes.jpg"   class="alignleft">
		<p class="leftcolumn">
		<i>written by Stephen King </i><br>
		there is a quote that i really like from this book 
		<q>Every religion lies. Every moral precept is a delusion. Even the stars are a mirage. The truth is darkness, and the only thing that matters is making a statement before one enters it. Cutting the skin of the world and leaving a scar. That’s all history is, after all: scar tissue.</q>
		it is said by Mr. Mercedes 
		I don’t know what is about Stephen King's writing , but it really does not draw me in.I don't know why this book take me so long to finish actually plot wasn't bad but the writing didn't make me turn pages in the book  maybe it's because the first time reading stephen king stunt me ...

		<img src="/images/Origin.jpeg" class="alignleft">
		<p class="leftcolumn">
		<i>written by Dan Brown</i><br>
		As always ,Dan Brown amazed me with his new book .
		The effort that was put in the book was incredible .
		Even the Domain for the news site in the book was prepared (although ,recently i thinks there are some errors i think i can't reach the website ) .
		And the artificial intelligance refrences in the book and the evolution of the human kind was very exciting to read .
		But to be honest -spoiler alert- after my favorite character -edmund- died i stopped reading for 1 week after that i could continue .
		Proffesor Robert Langdon arrives at Guggenheim Museum to attend one of the major announcement .
		Announcement is made by one of his students ,Edmund Krisch .Edmund was about to reveal is about to reveal an answer for two of the fundamental questions of human existence.
		The guests were welcomed by a new way of hosting .But the announcement erupts into chaos .Krisch's precious discovery is about to lost .Robert Langond tries to reveal his students remarkable discovery to the world.

		<h2 class="Clear" >Fahrenheit 451</h2>
		<img src="/images/fahrenheit451.jpg" class="alignleft">
		<p class="leftcolumn">
		<i>written by Ray Bradbury</i><br>
		I think this book needs to be read in more younger ages before people choose or decide about what to do with their life or before marrying someone .<br>
		The most touching part of the book for me was that the fireman realized him and his wife was just strangers to each other that he wouldn't even think if she was dead he wouldn't even cry <br>
		The poeple we spent our lives are very much important and choosing them is not easy.
		When we hit the old ages we should also have much to talk about,that's why i really like a person who has cultural knowledge because yuou have so much to talk with them .
		<br> And if they are respectful towards the person they are with ,it's wonderful ...

		<h2 class="Clear" >Tutunamayanlar</h2>
		<img src="/images/tutunamayanlar.jpg" class="alignleft">
		<p class="leftcolumn">
		<i>written by Oğuz Atay</i><br>
		First of all Oğuz atay is one of my favorite Turkish Writers i think his books are a masterpiece and every young Turk must read his books starting with "Bir Bilim Adamının Romanı" then Tutunamayanlar then continue to read ...  i have read both of them and i really liked the psychoanalysis and the contexts of the book .<br>
		Oğuz Atay makes us look from a different perspective to someones life he is definitely a good teller .In the book Tutunamayanlar he bring us a life of 2 very close friends . Both of them are engineers . (side note : maybe i really liked oğuz atay's book because you can sometimes see an engieer perspective in the books for example in the Tutunamayanlar those friends were also engineers and sometimes discuss about real life problems withing an enginner mindset) 
		<br>
		Those two friends Turgut and Selim reminded me an old friend that i had ,we used to argue a lot too . In the book Selim and Turgut make them selves a really good way to argue one of them becomes the president for that specific talk and the speech is recorded after they discuss the points which were useful which were againt the point of the conversation because if they don't do that they will en up in a fight between them .They want to argue but also keep their safety in check so they make a solutuion like this . 
		<br>
		Tutunamayanlar is an extraordinary book .It is hard to make a summary of the book . Because it is full of psychoanalysis ,evocation,details and impressions .
