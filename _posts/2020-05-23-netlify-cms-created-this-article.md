### Hello World ,

Today a word triggered me to search about a philosophical topic the word was ***"Tabula Rasa"*** John Locke is the founder of the theory. It means that individuals are born without built-in knowledge so all the knowledge in the human brain comes from experience and perception. While i was searching about it I also remembered our philosophy lesson in high school.
* We learned that Socrates thinks knowledge comes from within it's hardwired in the brain and the teacher only helps to bring that knowledge out. And I remembered a post that I saw about Socrates's thoughts about it "What if the cure for cancer is trapped in someone who can't get the right education and we would never reach that information" at first, I find Socrates very right because of the instinct of humans and choosing behavior but then I realized that people choose or behave based on their past experiences, for example, a robot can not choose between same 2 cubes, it just freezes because both of them are the same option (if there is no default optimization), but a human can choose based on their past experiences. But I cannot say that is also 100% true because in that case people are just their experiences, so by putting the exact same conditions for people would give the same mindset of people then but even the twins that raised in the same environment are very much different
* Inside my computer engineering class, there are twins that look exactly same, maybe from outside they kinda behave the same but when you get to know them u can see differences between them the way they dress or preferences of tv shows have a different turn.They share the same DNA same environment but still, there are differences ... So tabula rasa isn't also enough to fulfill our thought on the source of knowledge.
