So i watched a series called Euphoria.It's a highscool drama with a artistic cinematographig touches and that's what i think makes Euphoria stand out the other highschool dramas .<br>
Visuals are so strong on this series just take a look at the trailer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzPtTPtW-qg" target="_blank">Euphoria</a> <br>
The glitters espacially the cheekbones or the brow lines  of the actors are highleted and finished with a colorful touch . I am a person who loves bright,wicked colors and shiny things . SO the makeup in the euphoria really amazed me . <br>
the way they used the gilitter and colors are so damn on point that they look like their casual look efortless ... 
 so here are some makeups from series that i like .

I think Euphoria will be a trend settler for the new makeup era we well definitely see more glitter and more rhinestones on the makeup for sure . 
But aside that the plot of the movie was ordinary . Nothing new just a teen drama where everyone explores themselves and trying to fit in . But they make a good point about some subjects though . 
<br>
So this series is for the eyes . Visuals ,cinamatography and makups are well done . bu the subject is not so extraordinary . You decide for yourselves . 
I have also forgot about the soundtracks. SOUNDTRACKS ARE AMAZING  even if you don't watch the series you should definitely check out the soundtracks . here is a list of my favorites .
